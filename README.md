## Technical Details

### Architecture
- **GUI Framework:** tkinter with ttkthemes for modern styling
- **Anime API:** anipy-api for accessing anime sources
- **Download Engine:** Built-in downloader with ffmpeg integration
- **Threading:** Background operations to keep UI responsive

### Supported Formats
- **Video:** MP4, MKV (auto-conversion with ffmpeg)
- **Quality:** 360p, 480p, 720p, 1080p
- **Languages:** SUB (Subtitled) and DUB (Dubbed)

### Providers
Currently supports:
- GoGoAnime (default)
- Additional providers available through anipy-api

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Provider initialization failed"**
   - Check your internet connection
   - Ensure anipy-api is installed correctly

2. **"Download failed"**
   - Verify ffmpeg is installed and in PATH
   - Check available disk space
   - Try a different quality setting

3. **"Search returns no results"**
   - Try different search terms
   - Check if the anime exists on the provider

4. **GUI appears broken"**
   - Ensure ttkthemes is installed
   - Try running with `python -m tkinter` to test tkinter installation

### Performance Tips

- **Slower downloads:** Try lower quality settings or check your internet connection
- **High memory usage:** Close other applications during large batch downloads
- **GUI freezing:** This shouldn't happen due to threading, but restart if needed
